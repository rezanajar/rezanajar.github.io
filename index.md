## About Me
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I am an experienced engineer specializing in mathematical modeling, data-driven methods, and optimization methods with a focus on the applications of biomedical systems. I have a proven track record in collaborative research and interdisciplinary projects, particularly in the dynamics of the COVID-19 spread model. I am a strong communicator with experience as both a teaching and research assistant. I am eager to transition to academia as a professor to bridge the gap between engineering and health systems. I received my M.Sc. degree in 2022 from Shiraz University in Electrical Engineering, advised by Prof. Maryam Dehghani and Prof. Mohammad Hassan Asemani, and before my M.Sc. I obtained my B.Sc. in 2019 in the field of Electrical Engineering.
